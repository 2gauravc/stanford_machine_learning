# stanford_machine_learning
This the repository for the work done for completing the Machine Learning Course by Stanford University on Coursera

Each directory in the repository is for a particular assignment in the course. Usually each directory has a PDF file (e.g. ex1.pdf)
that explains the assignment, the files changed and the steps done.
